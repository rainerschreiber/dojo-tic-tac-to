# Tic Tac To - EA Sports, it's in the game :)

## Introduction

Rules:

* The board is a 3x3 grid, where each position is numbered from 1 to 9, from top left to bottom right
* There are two players in the game (X and O symbols)
* Players take turns by playing their symbol at a certain empty position until the game is over
* The first player to get 3 of their symbols in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner
* When all 9 squares are full, and there is no winner, the game ends in a draw

## How to play

This is a bot to bot game, so you don't need to do anything. Just watch the game unfold in the console output after you
run the Kotlin Spring Boot application.<br>

You need to:

* Build the Maven project
* Create a RunConfiguration based on Java17 and org.dojo.tictacto.TictactoApplication
* Now run the application

## Future improvements

* Add a CLI to play the game manually
* Add a Game Id and a Database to store the state of a game
* Make a REST API to play the game
* Add a GUI to play the game
